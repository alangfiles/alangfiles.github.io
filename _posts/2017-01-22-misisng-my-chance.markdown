 3rd week of 2017: I've been really enjoying Chance the Rapper's 3rd album.

 What has the last week brought?

 I updated my google extension, ported it over to a MS Edge extension, found out MS has a closed app store for extensions, so I've just gotta wait there. I'd like to try edge for everything, but that's not a good start.

I also pulled together some analytics for the hospital's surgical program, but the data requires such massaging from their original logbook format, I don't know if I can make an automated version to deliever stats. Hopefully these stats are useful to the hospital, not just interesting.
