5th week, and I've been listening to Neil Cic's new [Mouth Moods](https://m.soundcloud.com/neilcic/mouth-moods), and [PBS's Idea Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/pbsideachannel) (which is really good and you should sub to). And I just really enjoy thinking about mashups, youtube, and what art looks like 'because internet'. And then I think about all the presidential news and fake news, and how someone's facebook can become an echo chamber, or a window into the world, but it requires cultivation.

and it all culminates in the thought that we're just scratching the surface of the internet, what it is and what it'll do for us, good and bad. 

Here's what I don't look like, from the past two weeks:
