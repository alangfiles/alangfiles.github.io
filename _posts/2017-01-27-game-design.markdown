After reading some of Jonathan Blow's blog, he linked this [Raph Koster piece](http://www.raphkoster.com/2006/11/10/project-horseshoe-influences/): 

> Once upon a time, Picasso was shocking. Nowadays, you walk into generic hotel on the road, and you’re just as likely to see something Cubist as you are to see a watercolor landscape. We take it for granted., Everyone knows how to read that now. It’s no big deal. But we don’t even scratch the surface on these other art styles and influences and sources of inspiration.

> The challenge that I leave you with is whether or not games are irredeemably spreadsheets in this sense. And I don’t mean the stories we tack on top of them, the pretty art. Because the art and the stories, we know they can do this. The challenge is whether games can do it on their own, without being propped up by all this other stuff.

I really thought that [The Witness](http://the-witness.net/) was one of the best games I've ever played, and I think the above statements are why. The Witness seeks to be more than just 'a spreadsheet' with a story tacked on. The game is about learning. Not learning how to solve a puzzle, but learning how to learn to sovle a puzzle.

I wonder if I can make something so interesting.
