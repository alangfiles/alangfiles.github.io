I've been trying to plan out my whole year. I've got some ideas.

No matter how many times I listen to it, John Coltrane's 'Love Supreme' always invokes in me the most profound disinterest. It's like riding the world's best elevator.*

*this should more be a comment on my lack of musical knowledge than anything else, also, a slight nod to my enjoying going up and down.

Also, for enjoyment, I think you'd like to see my current holds at the library:

Norm MacDonald - based on a true story #8 on 2 copies
Turing's Catherdral  #1 on #1 copy
Children of Dune #2 on 1 copy
A People's History of the United States #18 on 2 coopies
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child #196 on 170 copies
A Full Life - Jimmy Carter  #1 on 1 copy
Rouge One (the novelization) #107 on 5 copies (hey, being in rural kenya makes it hard to go to the movies)
