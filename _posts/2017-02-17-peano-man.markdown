Lots of visitors to Kenya over the last couple of weeks, stayed in Nairobi with some bedbugs. Walked around, enjoyed old friendships.

I think the amazing thing about the human experience is that location is easily assimilated (a lot of things probably are), you can be in a beautiful location, with a million things to do, and be happiest reading a book, or watching a tv show with a friend, or just talking. What creatures we are.

I also started a small video project for the hospital, and hopefully I get all that smoothed out before I leave. I think I'll have some time in March to try and batten all the hatches, or row up my ducks, or whatever people say now.

I've also been working on a talk about Peano arithmetic, and implementations across programming languages, in the hopes of coming up with a funny talk that makes fun with math. Raymond Smullyan died a couple of weeks ago, and his love for logic makes me smile. I saw this:
> What do I need to worry about my death for? It won't happen in my lifetime. -R. Smullyan
So maybe I can do something fun with the peano.
