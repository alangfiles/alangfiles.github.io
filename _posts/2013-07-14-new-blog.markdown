So, I've put together a new blog, using [Github][github] to host it, and [Jekyll][jekyll] for some templating. It was pretty easy to get it all up and running, and the jekyll stuff stays out of the way. 

Hopefully, I'll post some pictures, and some insights, but for now, this blog is, as was so elloquently shown in many geocities gifs 'under construction'.
